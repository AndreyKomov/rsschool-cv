### Summary

Html Academy introduced Front-End Development to me. I became interested in practical tasks and have begun to read additional materials. I have successfully performed number of tasks. It has really motivated me to proceed. My experience in engineering helps me to examine the objectives and calculate the most effective method of achieving them. I think Iâ€™m learning fast, and I also feel that I can be considered a hard-working and open-minded student.
The most important thing for me is practice: that's why the possibility to code non-stop is much more attractive to me than reading any book from my shelf. At present my goal is to get practical skills for the purpose to get a junior developer position. I think that time and practice are keys to success.
