### Summary

I am a self taught Junior JS Developer. Twelve years ago I graduated from the university and got my degree in engineering. But it did not suit me. Not properly. I wanted more. Html Academy and RS School have jointly introduced front-end development to me. Dynamic interface, diverse accessibility, improved performance, speedy development have taught me to distinguish a malfunctioning, poor site from a well designed, flexible, and user-friendly site.

The possibility to be part of it inspires me a lot. I am capable of making a success of my prospective career as a software engineer. I am hard-working and open-minded, I have no troubles in working under pressure and meeting deadlines. I think it is what we have in common with experienced JS developers.

To cut a long story short,  I am open to any job opportunity, including internship.
